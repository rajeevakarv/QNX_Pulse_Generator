Project #3: Design and implement an embedded, stand-alone QNX Neutrino program 
to generate a 1.0 kHz square wave (50% duty cycle) on the parallel printer port using 
QNX Neutrino delay and timing primitives. Using the program from Project #1, measure 
the interarrival time variations between rising edges of the generated square wave and 
tabulate 1000 interarrival times. You may wish to update your measurement program 
from Project #1 to increase itâ€™s accuracy (i.e. use timer interrupts.) 
 
Graduate students: Modify your Project #1 program to capture the maximum and the 
minimum interarrival times and to display those values appropriately labeled at the end 
of your histogram output. The minimum and maximum interarrival times may be beyond 
the range of the original histogram limits.
